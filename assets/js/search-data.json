            "content": "This is a dashboard of time series data from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 public dataset, which is updated daily with confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered counts from around the world. . North America . Exponential everywhere, and not enough testing. . countries = [&#39;US&#39;, &#39;Canada&#39;, &#39;Mexico&#39;] states = [&#39;&#39;] * len(countries) start_dates = [&#39;3/7/20&#39;] * len(countries) states_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;state&#39;: states, &#39;country&#39;: countries, &#39;start_date&#39;: start_dates}) generate_plots(states_df, COLUMNS) plt.show() . States in the United Sates . This is time series data for each state in the United States. Since there was no widespread testing in the United States prior to the first week of March, all of the time series plots start on `3/7/20&#39;. . Despite limited testing in the US, it&#39;s clear that every single state reporting is showing an exponential curve. . Within the United States, there are many regions, e.g., counties and cities (and cruise ships!) in there as well. The state data should be considered authoritative for cases within a state. See the appendix (likely will be moved to another notebook in the future) for an example of how this is the case for Washington State and its county data. . states_df = pd.read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jflam/covid19/master/data/states.csv&quot;) countries = [&#39;US&#39;] * len(states_df) start_dates = [&#39;3/7/20&#39;] * len(states_df) states_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;state&#39;: states_df[&quot;State&quot;], &#39;country&#39;: countries, &#39;start_date&#39;: start_dates}) generate_plots(states_df, COLUMNS) plt.show() . Provinces in Canada . It looks like BC was testing from a pretty early point in time. Most other provinces didn&#39;t start testing until much, much later. Ontario and Quebec both have rather steep slopes right now, albeit with relatively small numbers overall. But again, likely due to lack of testing. . provinces = [&#39;British Columbia&#39;, &#39;Alberta&#39;, &#39;Saskatchewan&#39;, &#39;Manitoba&#39;, &#39;Ontario&#39;, &#39;Quebec&#39;, &#39;New Brunswick&#39;, &#39;Nova Scotia&#39;, &#39;Prince Edward Island&#39;, &#39;Newfoundland and Labrador&#39;] countries = [&#39;Canada&#39;] * len(provinces) start_dates = [&#39;2/1/20&#39;] * len(provinces) canada_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;state&#39;: provinces, &#39;country&#39;: countries, &#39;start_date&#39;: start_dates}) generate_plots(canada_df, COLUMNS) plt.show() . Selected Asian countries . It looks like China has had things under control for a while. South Korea is making good progress in turning the confirmed cases curve. Singapore and Taiwan had great early success, but it looks like visitors are driving infection rates rapidly now. . countries = [&#39;China&#39;, &#39;Korea, South&#39;, &#39;Singapore&#39;, &#39;Japan&#39;, &#39;Taiwan*&#39;, &#39;India&#39;] states = [&#39;&#39;] * len(countries) start_dates = [&#39;1/22/20&#39;] * len(countries) asian_countries_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;state&#39;: states, &#39;country&#39;: countries, &#39;start_date&#39;: start_dates}) generate_plots(asian_countries_df, COLUMNS) plt.show() . Europe . The curve is exponential pretty much everywhere right now. . europe_df = pd.read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jflam/covid19/master/data/Countries-Europe.csv&quot;) states = [&#39;&#39;] * len(europe_df) start_dates = [&#39;2/21/20&#39;] * len(europe_df) europe_countries_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;state&#39;: states, &#39;country&#39;: europe_df[&#39;name&#39;].sort_values(), &#39;start_date&#39;: start_dates}) generate_plots(europe_countries_df, COLUMNS) plt.show() .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. .

Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(movies).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=600, height=400 ) .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
